todo:
- ADD THE PATCH RANDOM SPECTROGRAM CODE
- TRAIN THE WHOLE MODEL
- ADD THE CROSS-FOLDER VALIDATION LOOP
- ADD MODULES TO THE CODE BECAUSE NOW IT IS BECOMING CONFUSING

Notice: 
- the shuffle in the dataset split is only for make it run. It will need to be modified or handle in a diferent way for the validation or for a real run

- does the memory increase for the number of workers?
